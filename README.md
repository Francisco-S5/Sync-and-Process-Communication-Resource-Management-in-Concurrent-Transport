# Sync-and-Process-Communication-Resource-Management-in-Concurrent-Transport
This project simulates a barge loading system using inter-process communication (IPC) in Linux. It coordinates multiple processes representing trucks and trailers to fully occupy the barge before departure. IPC mechanisms ensure proper synchronization and efficient shared resource management.
